# Editor - Image Cropper (Python)

The main objective of this project is to create a program that will act as an editor of sorts. It will go through an user's files, making changes to files as it sees fit. 

The first iteration of this program will crop multiple images using a template chosen by user.

In the future, Editor will go through correcting mistakes in notes and logging them, backing up files on a schedule, and more tasks as I imagine them.
